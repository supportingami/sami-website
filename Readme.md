## Overview

**ðŸš§ Under Development**  
This will be the repo to support the new SAMI website

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
2. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) v2

## Installation

### 1. Clone the application

```sh
git clone https://github.com/supportingami/sami-website
```

Checkout files stored with git large file system

```
git lfs checkout
```

### 2. Install necessary dependencies for the frontend application

```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Create access token and admin user for the backend

```sh
yarn scripts strapi bootstrap
```

### 4. Import data

```sh
yarn scripts strapi import
```

### 5. Start the backend and frontend

```sh
yarn start
```

This will run both backend and frontend serve scripts

Backend: http://localhost:1337/admin
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### 6. Authorize data

Any endpoints that are not publically accessible will not be available to the frontend unless a api token is generated and populated.

See instructions in [docs/api-queries.md](docs\api-queries.md)
