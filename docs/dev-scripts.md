# Development Scripts

Various development scripts exist to facilitate various development tasks

Commands are located `scripts\src\commands`, and namespaced depending on type of task, and will often contain various subcommands

A list of all top-level commands can be seen via

```sh
yarn scripts
```

Subcommands can then be interrogated in the same way, e.g.

```sh
yarn scripts strapi
```

## Troubleshooting

```
strapi boostrap
error: The port 1337 is already used by another application
```

Some strapi scripts like `data:export` create their own strapi instance and so can only be executed whilst the default server is not running (e.g. following `yarn start`)

```
strapi types:generate

âœ– Failed to load schema
```

Other scripts require the main strapi instance to be running, i.e. via `yarn start`
