      <h2>SAMI Theory of Change</h2>
      <p>
        At SAMI weâ€™ve been working to build our thoughts on how everything we do can fit into a larger picture to create
        real change across Africa.
        <br />
        <br />
        We hope to use this section to communicate some of these ideas when they are slightly further developed. In the
        meantime you can see our current working document below.
