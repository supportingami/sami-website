Further, we aim to have at least one international teacher at each camp, either a current teacher or a retired teacher. We aim to also have three student international volunteers participate in each of the AMI camps, with the volunteers being a mixture of undergrads and postgrads/researchers. We would be happy to hear from people in other walks of life who feel they have something to contribute, and we would consider recommending high school students for this experience.</i></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>The recruitment of international volunteers has begun and we will be considering applications on a rolling basis until the start of the camps.&nbsp;You can mention a preference for a camp in your application, but you don’t have to.&nbsp;Decisions on applications will be made by the SAMI Trustees, who then recommend suitable candidates to the local organisers of the respective camps. Note: all camps are run through local partners. As such, dates and venues are subject to change. Do not make any flight or accommodation booking until you have confirmed the camp dates with the local organiser. SAMI cannot accept responsibility for any financial loss occurred due to the changes in dates or venues for any of the camps.</i></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>FAQs can&nbsp;be found below.&nbsp;If you would like to know more&nbsp;please write to&nbsp;</i><a href=\"mailto:admin@supportingami.org\"><i>admin@supportingami.org</i></a><i>.
