Establishing AMI, one of their cornerstones initiatives was to provide opportunities for students to see the beauty, excitement and usefulness of mathematics in the real world. They did this via an annual maths camp, hosted at the local university and open to students from nearby secondary schools.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Since 2011 the camp has extended to Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and even London, and each year supports a mix of around 500 students, teachers and volunteers. We reached and important milestone in 2016, where two separate camps were organised and run entirely by local volunteers, hosted at the </span><a href=\"http://www.lewa.org/\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">LEWA Wildlife Conservancy</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">.</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">What is a maths camp?</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Each camp usually consists of an initial planning week for volunteers, and then a second week of activities for students.
