Following the classic proverb ‘it takes a village’ we aim to bring people together of all ages and vocations to use technology for good through education, training and research.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">SAMI will draw on the experience and expertise its members, local partners across Africa and further international experts to design series of interventions that will all be run using tablet computers and facilitated by local university students and NGOs. &nbsp;Initially we will be looking to use the tablets to impact on the following areas:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Primary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Secondary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Agriculture</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Women's Enterprises</strong></a></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"dci-1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" width=\"300\" loading=\"eager\">Tablets will be loaded with apps proven to help students improve basic numeracy skills, reading skills, and make a shift from rote “chalk and talk” learning to more learner-centered approaches. It is our hope that by doing this these children will be given a strong foundation of basic education, something vital so that they do not get left behind in the future.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br><strong>The next steps</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A fantastic team of local and international experts are currently being assembled whilst equipment is put together and resources developed. Project meetings will be taking place across August with an official launch in September 2016.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For more information you can follow <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/supportingami\">SAMI on facebook</a>, or contact <a href=\"mailto:chris@supportingami.org\">chris@supportingami.org</a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconEduFoundation-square120-1.png?resize=120%2C117&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"EconEduFoundation-square120-1\" loading=\"eager\"></a>SAMI would also like to give a huge thanks to the generosity of the<a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"> Economist Foundation</a> for making the Digital Communities Initiative possible.</p>",

    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">When we started the project back in August 2016 there was lots of discussion about what would be the best apps to use if we really wanted to impact student’s learning in schools. Whilst searching the app store for ‘Maths Education’ the options seem near endless, the number with a strong base of evidence for improving learning are few and far between. If you also include those which are available in local languages, or at least that have been used in East Africa the results became practically non-existent.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The real stand-out amongst the rest was an app called <a href=\"https://onebillion.org/\">OneBillion</a>, created by a team in the UK but piloted in Malawi it aims to help build basic numeracy skills for children aged 3-7. It has been subject to a number of rigorous, randomised control trials, and consistently shown impressive results both in Africa and back in the UK.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png\" alt=\"2019_07-onebillion_Large.png\" srcset=\"/uploads/thumbnail_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 245w,/uploads/small_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 500w,/uploads/medium_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 750w,\" sizes=\"100vw\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A lot has happened in the nearly 3-years since starting this project. There was a global competition called the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/prizes/global-learning\">Global Learning X-Prize</a>, in which 150 teams from around the world competed over 2 years to produce a technology-based solution that could help children around the world team themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic. These teams were reduced to 5 finalists, which then spent a further 2 years undergoing a large scale trial of their apps with 2,500 students in Tanzania. Just last month the grand prize of $15M was awarded, and actually split between two teams, KitKit School – a collaborative game created by teams at Berkely, US and Seoul, South Korea, and OneBillion!</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We, of course, would like to share a huge congratulations to all the teams who took part and the overall winners. It has been incredibly exciting to see just how much the landscape of educational technology has changed in such a short time and provides some incredible opportunities for the future. We look forward to continuing our work with such fantastic partners and are highly grateful for the support from everyone who has helped enable us to bring these opportunities to children in Kenya.

    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With schools across Africa closing their doors to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 virus,&nbsp; millions of students in the country are facing disruption to their daily education. In these new realities, there is an urgent need to invest now in education systems/programs that can help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s education. What roles can different organizations play to either support schools, children or teachers to address the challenges presented by this pandemic?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For over 8 years, Supporting African Maths Initiatives (SAMI) has long supported innovative STEM education programs that supplement classroom learning and draw from existing best practices in education theory. In some of our programs, we have leveraged on the power of open source technology to make learning possible in different schools. Some of our programs that required school visits have been disrupted but we are finding ways to keep on supporting teachers and schools in Africa.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Some of our programs have been addressing gaps in teacher training and promoting the use of technology in teaching and learning of mathematics in secondary schools in countries such as Kenya and Ghana. This is one area that we have chosen to focus on under these new realities.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With only two hours difference, it’s noon in London and 2:00 pm in Kenya. Three facilitators, Emily, Samuel, and Jacob are engaging secondary school maths teachers in virtual training using google hangouts and GeoGebra. In this session, the teachers were exploring geometrical shapes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These teams of trainers have been working hard to create Geogebra teacher training resources. GeoGebra is mathematics software for all levels of education that brings together geometry, algebra, spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Other teams within SAMI and African Maths Initiative (AMI) have been designing and authoring interactive mathematics using the System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel (STACK) for Moodle. This is an online computer-aided assessment system for mathematics that also randomly generates problems in a structured mathematical way, establishes the mathematical properties of expressions entered by students and it also generates feedback, as necessary, which may include mathematical computations of the student’s answer.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These efforts could enable teachers, schools, and countries to prepare alternative learning programmes in the case of prolonged school closures by ensuring the continuity of quality learning and access to remote learning programs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We believe that actively pursuing content creation and knowledge sharing through teacher training and capacity building will help us to deploy innovative and scalable solutions that boost mathematical literacy now and in the future. Learn how you can help achieve this goal!</p>",

As I write this, the world is experiencing major societal shifts in work and education. Universities and other schools and industries are re-evaluating their roles now and what they can be in the future.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">In our work in education and research, we have seen schools and universities struggle to adopt meaningful ways to improve 21st-century learning. The skill sets required for current innovators and the workforce is still a missing gap that needs to be filled.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">How can we recast educational systems while being cognisant that creating change is nothing but a daunting task? How can we ensure that we can achieve rapid learning and rapid execution to stay ahead?<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">After years of conversations, research, and meaningful collaboration with universities, research institutions, and colleges, we were glad to collaborate with Manor House Agricultural College, African Maths Initiative, and IDEMS International. January 2020 saw us offer a month-long Foundational in 21st Century Skills course. One of the major aims was to cultivate skills such as programming, critical and logical thinking, media making, data literacy, and communication among persons of different backgrounds. These students could be young people awaiting to join universities,colleges or self-employment, current university/college students, unemployed youth, or professionals who would want to learn these skills.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We took in 12 students for a start and within a month the young and timid students had grown in remarkable ways. Things did not end there. As part of our capacity building, we took in six of these students as interns since February 2020. This was a chance for the students to work on a Collaborative Group Project on Web Technologies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">They are now learning employable skills in web and app development. In just over three months, we have enabled them to learn skills useful in the work we are doing with our partners; Oxford, CWBSA, UNICEF, UCT and they are now fully involved in the development of Parenting For Long-life Health Mobile application which is a suite of open access, non-commercialized parenting programs to prevent violence in low-resource settings in 20 low and middle-income countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">While reminiscing about what they learned in January, flexibility, independent learning, and adapting to unexpected changes were a major part of the Foundational 21st Century Skills course back in January. Even though most of the classes were in a physical place, assignments, communication, and learning were online through platforms such as MOODLE. A few weeks after the lapse of the course, a coronavirus pandemic hit the world, and we now live in extraordinary times. The world transformed within months if not weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Virtual work became the only option for us and luckily, we had introduced them to this world of work and we are glad to have this team of learners and our other Kenyan team collaboratively work on projects such as Parenting for Long-Life with other teams across the world. The team is meeting regularly to discuss what’s needed for the application they are contributing to.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We understand that this learning while working virtually will be a process for all of us. But we have to do this to keep safe as we can and wait for things to get better.</p>",
