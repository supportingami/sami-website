Following the classic proverb ‘it takes a village’ we aim to bring people together of all ages and vocations to use technology for good through education, training and research.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">SAMI will draw on the experience and expertise its members, local partners across Africa and further international experts to design series of interventions that will all be run using tablet computers and facilitated by local university students and NGOs. &nbsp;Initially we will be looking to use the tablets to impact on the following areas:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Primary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Secondary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Agriculture</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Women's Enterprises</strong></a></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"dci-1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" width=\"300\" loading=\"eager\">Tablets will be loaded with apps proven to help students improve basic numeracy skills, reading skills, and make a shift from rote “chalk and talk” learning to more learner-centered approaches. It is our hope that by doing this these children will be given a strong foundation of basic education, something vital so that they do not get left behind in the future.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br><strong>The next steps</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A fantastic team of local and international experts are currently being assembled whilst equipment is put together and resources developed. Project meetings will be taking place across August with an official launch in September 2016.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For more information you can follow <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/supportingami\">SAMI on facebook</a>, or contact <a href=\"mailto:chris@supportingami.org\">chris@supportingami.org</a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconEduFoundation-square120-1.png?resize=120%2C117&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"EconEduFoundation-square120-1\" loading=\"eager\"></a>SAMI would also like to give a huge thanks to the generosity of the<a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"> Economist Foundation</a> for making the Digital Communities Initiative possible.</p>",

    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">When we started the project back in August 2016 there was lots of discussion about what would be the best apps to use if we really wanted to impact student’s learning in schools. Whilst searching the app store for ‘Maths Education’ the options seem near endless, the number with a strong base of evidence for improving learning are few and far between. If you also include those which are available in local languages, or at least that have been used in East Africa the results became practically non-existent.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The real stand-out amongst the rest was an app called <a href=\"https://onebillion.org/\">OneBillion</a>, created by a team in the UK but piloted in Malawi it aims to help build basic numeracy skills for children aged 3-7. It has been subject to a number of rigorous, randomised control trials, and consistently shown impressive results both in Africa and back in the UK.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png\" alt=\"2019_07-onebillion_Large.png\" srcset=\"/uploads/thumbnail_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 245w,/uploads/small_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 500w,/uploads/medium_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 750w,\" sizes=\"100vw\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A lot has happened in the nearly 3-years since starting this project. There was a global competition called the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/prizes/global-learning\">Global Learning X-Prize</a>, in which 150 teams from around the world competed over 2 years to produce a technology-based solution that could help children around the world team themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic. These teams were reduced to 5 finalists, which then spent a further 2 years undergoing a large scale trial of their apps with 2,500 students in Tanzania. Just last month the grand prize of $15M was awarded, and actually split between two teams, KitKit School – a collaborative game created by teams at Berkely, US and Seoul, South Korea, and OneBillion!</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We, of course, would like to share a huge congratulations to all the teams who took part and the overall winners. It has been incredibly exciting to see just how much the landscape of educational technology has changed in such a short time and provides some incredible opportunities for the future. We look forward to continuing our work with such fantastic partners and are highly grateful for the support from everyone who has helped enable us to bring these opportunities to children in Kenya.

    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With schools across Africa closing their doors to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 virus,&nbsp; millions of students in the country are facing disruption to their daily education. In these new realities, there is an urgent need to invest now in education systems/programs that can help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s education. What roles can different organizations play to either support schools, children or teachers to address the challenges presented by this pandemic?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For over 8 years, Supporting African Maths Initiatives (SAMI) has long supported innovative STEM education programs that supplement classroom learning and draw from existing best practices in education theory. In some of our programs, we have leveraged on the power of open source technology to make learning possible in different schools. Some of our programs that required school visits have been disrupted but we are finding ways to keep on supporting teachers and schools in Africa.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Some of our programs have been addressing gaps in teacher training and promoting the use of technology in teaching and learning of mathematics in secondary schools in countries such as Kenya and Ghana. This is one area that we have chosen to focus on under these new realities.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With only two hours difference, it’s noon in London and 2:00 pm in Kenya. Three facilitators, Emily, Samuel, and Jacob are engaging secondary school maths teachers in virtual training using google hangouts and GeoGebra. In this session, the teachers were exploring geometrical shapes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These teams of trainers have been working hard to create Geogebra teacher training resources. GeoGebra is mathematics software for all levels of education that brings together geometry, algebra, spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Other teams within SAMI and African Maths Initiative (AMI) have been designing and authoring interactive mathematics using the System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel (STACK) for Moodle. This is an online computer-aided assessment system for mathematics that also randomly generates problems in a structured mathematical way, establishes the mathematical properties of expressions entered by students and it also generates feedback, as necessary, which may include mathematical computations of the student’s answer.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These efforts could enable teachers, schools, and countries to prepare alternative learning programmes in the case of prolonged school closures by ensuring the continuity of quality learning and access to remote learning programs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We believe that actively pursuing content creation and knowledge sharing through teacher training and capacity building will help us to deploy innovative and scalable solutions that boost mathematical literacy now and in the future. Learn how you can help achieve this goal!</p>",

As I write this, the world is experiencing major societal shifts in work and education. Universities and other schools and industries are re-evaluating their roles now and what they can be in the future.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">In our work in education and research, we have seen schools and universities struggle to adopt meaningful ways to improve 21st-century learning. The skill sets required for current innovators and the workforce is still a missing gap that needs to be filled.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">How can we recast educational systems while being cognisant that creating change is nothing but a daunting task? How can we ensure that we can achieve rapid learning and rapid execution to stay ahead?<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">After years of conversations, research, and meaningful collaboration with universities, research institutions, and colleges, we were glad to collaborate with Manor House Agricultural College, African Maths Initiative, and IDEMS International. January 2020 saw us offer a month-long Foundational in 21st Century Skills course. One of the major aims was to cultivate skills such as programming, critical and logical thinking, media making, data literacy, and communication among persons of different backgrounds. These students could be young people awaiting to join universities,colleges or self-employment, current university/college students, unemployed youth, or professionals who would want to learn these skills.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We took in 12 students for a start and within a month the young and timid students had grown in remarkable ways. Things did not end there. As part of our capacity building, we took in six of these students as interns since February 2020. This was a chance for the students to work on a Collaborative Group Project on Web Technologies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">They are now learning employable skills in web and app development. In just over three months, we have enabled them to learn skills useful in the work we are doing with our partners; Oxford, CWBSA, UNICEF, UCT and they are now fully involved in the development of Parenting For Long-life Health Mobile application which is a suite of open access, non-commercialized parenting programs to prevent violence in low-resource settings in 20 low and middle-income countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">While reminiscing about what they learned in January, flexibility, independent learning, and adapting to unexpected changes were a major part of the Foundational 21st Century Skills course back in January. Even though most of the classes were in a physical place, assignments, communication, and learning were online through platforms such as MOODLE. A few weeks after the lapse of the course, a coronavirus pandemic hit the world, and we now live in extraordinary times. The world transformed within months if not weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Virtual work became the only option for us and luckily, we had introduced them to this world of work and we are glad to have this team of learners and our other Kenyan team collaboratively work on projects such as Parenting for Long-Life with other teams across the world. The team is meeting regularly to discuss what’s needed for the application they are contributing to.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We understand that this learning while working virtually will be a process for all of us. But we have to do this to keep safe as we can and wait for things to get better.</p>",

The Kenya Maths Camp in December brought together 7 international volunteers and 7 local volunteers, who spent a week in preparation brainstorming new approaches to help students experience mathematics as an interesting, fun, and engaging subject. The goal was to make the students believe they are capable of learning anything. &nbsp;Teachers had the opportunity to grow professionally and learn new teaching techniques throughout the week-long preparation.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">52 students joined the camp from 29 different schools around Kenya. The students were aged between 14 and 19 years with 73% of the students being female. This camp presented a bigger perspective on how to inspire the students to be aware of, understand, believe in, and be intrinsically motivated to learn through play and enjoy thinking in inclusive activities that revolve around 6 themes. The themes included programming and robotics, modelling, mathematical thinking, data science, games and puzzles. Here is a summary of the students' expectations at the beginning of the camp from the entry survey:</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:611.89px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WpR8zY8seigI-GkG0MlNSIxD8wuwcAExkMTkchwnw3MGRfjmKjUtgmpt1dzinwoNQWTRWWjI-wZuUPsV0622wfjJPMZ1OaGhA8es7JN6ZGAe0pd8WY_0g7XIWn76vZVNjAAVzV_KFegh7VnEPSJDBFo\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><i>Fig: Summary of the students' expectations at the beginning of the camp from the entry survey</i></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Themes</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:689.5px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5evcOxTnjiYkEmeQHv-R1Bzcisnlg_VbZmLFY1KgUB-cz457VU_B-ciybzcNOcmkkFTSkiN5wWWzyZl5VFnVhpihgVn9p5Tm4Wtw41vZ-jtNeUYGN6dwDEAzRveVWpFDwXy9T21GyRCNp9LqC_MY2js\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

The subject had six sessions planned to be carried out in the mathcamp. This contains the factors and multiples, world cup combinatorics, Divisibility rule, Barcode trick, olympic rings and Venn Diagram. The sessions were designed to instil a serious issue. The sessions were designed to establish in the participants a solid understanding of mathematics, a methodical approach to thinking, and a high degree of organisation.</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Factors and multiples </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">a session driven by the ability to observe and formulate hypotheses into strategies.

Participants investigate the mathematics underlying tournament organization, including the number of games in group rounds, the total number of teams participating in the knockout rounds, and the number of games played overall. They then use these findings to create their own tournaments with various team counts.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:548px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cUrly8H98Lilu5BX7BlsL4WRjbEnXxU_9zYTbkg32_T_yJVLwkRRsR10raHs4etVOWrNgQYvmh0PUwVPum9ysdeSTMh7y7qv2dlbuk0RGdTibUfS319puMSfruoQU1-i9cYesCb7w36w8mTd_fsmgOQ\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><i>Fig: Showing Students entries about the session as recorded in daily journal</i></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Divisibility rule </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">a number is divisible by 2 if the last digit is a zero or even number. A lot of emphasis has always been placed on working with the divisibility test but not on gaining a thorough understanding of how it works.Participants were able to develop divisibility rules and were encouraged to develop their own using different numbers.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Barcodes </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">since they help shops assign the right price and keep track of sales, bar codes are crucial. The 13-digit EAN bar code is supported by some amazing Maths. Participants could see how crucial the check digit is and how the scanner does calculations to match the check digit in order for the barcode to function properly.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>The Olympic game/magic/ring </strong>session introduced learners to the concept of the use of venn diagrams. An olympic emblem &nbsp;(T</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">he Olympic emblem consists of five overlapping rings containing nine regions), was drawn and the main idea was&nbsp;to Place the numbers 1, 2, 3, … 9 in the nine regions so that the total in each ring is the same.

It also helped students to solve complex mathematical problems which were in the form of a riddle and provided an intuitive understanding of multiple regression analysis between more variables.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Data Science</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Data science is becoming increasingly &nbsp;relevant in the workplace and everyday life; therefore, there was a need for camp participants to have the opportunity to work with data and view data science as inviting and feasible. The five sessions focussed on them understanding the world through data exploration. They worked with different data sets, summarised, visualised and interpreted data advancing their skills to use data as evidence to support their claims.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Introduction to Statistics. </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">This was the opening session where we collected data from students as a student entry survey. Data collected during this session were used during other sessions like; data cleaning and statistical data analysis. The main objective of this session was to introduce students how to express their daily activities mathematically more so statistically.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Data Cleaning </strong>session was done where the data collected during maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;camp entry survey session was fixed by removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate or incomplete data within that dataset.

The physical activities that formed an integral part of this theme include Trading game, concentration game, flag game, mingle mingle, find the ball and treasure hunt.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Concentration games</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">build concentration, good memory, better coordination and have fun. The participants and the team leader stand in a circle and the team leader says “concentration is the game, keep the rhythm if you can”. The crowd repeats, as they clap twice and tap their legs twice. Continue clapping like that. In the meantime, the leader says his own name twice and someone else's name twice.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Flag game</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The group is split into two teams and they then stand in two lines facing each other. One person needs to be in the middle to call and judge. In the middle of the two teams an (object) is placed. Each player is numbered with someone on the other side. Each round the caller calls a number and each matching pair must race to get the ball and get back to their line before being touched. If touched the ball goes to the other side, points may be kept.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Mingle mingle </strong></span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The players move around mingling as the leader chants\" In twos, In threes etc\" as the players from the groups with the total number that is said out aloud.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Find the ball</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">This is a team activity involving one blind folded individual from a team who has to be directed by their respective team towards a certain object(ball).

Participants had to go to artificial shops, where they could buy both legal and criminal things for 230 shillings, and they were permitted to profit from their purchases. To discourage the acquisition of illegal goods, the police were there. Each attendee got the chance to take something away from the session.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:666px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5h0Dh0ceA4IWi43QQuxDg1Lvqpf37iGEUudmxw1-ucxsmjAyYLzqE_tdNe5IdUC_y2RicxKlDXEUHCytHp_qbfhY80LKgUNXJxFWR2bZ4veu-8rnPlx8xFNyYvVSeYeSgpnYAeMWa9w4v1Hqr26FqjI\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><i>Fig: Showing flag game in progress</i></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Games and Puzzles</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The students solved various games and puzzles daily. The activities covered a number of areas including: Logic puzzles, Time distance maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">, Brain Teasers, Probability concepts and Number challenge(s).</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Puzzles were placed in the walls within their learning library section for the students to solve whenever they were free, most of the students could write them up in the evening and do as take home assignments. They found some of the puzzles challenging but they still found enjoyment in the process of discovery and solving them. They could then solve the challenging puzzles as a class every morning before the camp’s normal sessions start off.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Games and puzzles at the Camp gave the students the opportunities to explore problem solving concepts since they were able to take the role of facilitation. The students were more than just problem solvers, they supported others to engage in games and puzzles by making sure that: others understood the puzzles, encouraged them to ask questions for clarification, broke down the puzzle into smaller parts and they were able to reframe the puzzles. Games were played in groups, each group had a different facilitator for different games who was able to actively tell stories and create activities which related the mathematical ideas to spark memory for the other participants in the group.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Treasure hunt </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The maths camp treasure hunt taught the participants how much fun it is to solve problems in their own unique ways. It gave participants the chance to assist others in solving challenges by observing where they are and guiding them to the next move. To advance to the next station, teams have to solve puzzles. They will learn the upcoming puzzles at these stations. Through this self-directed activity, the participants learned the value of sequencing—the order of steps—and were given the freedom to finish a task independently in each of their respective groups.

Working with others allowed them to pool their thoughts and look at problems from different angles. During competitions for example in physical activity and treasure hunt, members of the houses utilised a variety of skills and expertise they have to strategize and solve problems. Working in houses also allowed for more in-depth and broad research, as well as the opportunity to learn from one another by discussing, gaming, and playing, as well as exploring questions and thoughts and receiving feedback from peers.</span></p><h1 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Maths Game Ambassador and Next Steps</span></h1><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Since the training of level 1 ambassadors earlier in the year and inspiring active champions and ambassadors of maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;games during both camps, the trained envoys are out of school and ready to learn together and serve the community in curriculum-agnostic mathematics.

Debora has had an opportunity to attend a maths&nbsp;camp in October 2021 and March/April 2022 apart from being one of the 30 ambassadors trained and sworn as maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;game ambassador in Feb 2022.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">In her testimony during the closing, she wishes she would have attended the camps since her form one as her problem solving, communication and presentation, critical and logical thinking skills improved during her opportunity to join the camp and interact with students from different schools, facilitators and the activities introduced to during the camp.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Debora is looking forward to facilitating sessions at the next camp and inspiring other students to become champions and ambassadors of maths&nbsp;games. Debora, amongst other 24 students trained as level one ambassadors earlier this year will be out of secondary schools as they make plans for college applications and other engagements. The envoys will be available for next training as level 2 ambassadors as they get ready to inspire others to become active champions and ambassadors of maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;games to support others to learn and play.</span></p><h1 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Conclusion</span></h1><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Kenya Maths Camp December 2022 brought together international volunteers from six different countries around the world amongst education officials and policy makers with interest in running maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;camps in South Sudan and The Gambia come early 2023. The two weeks for preparation and camping brought the opportunity for volunteers to participate in creating and sharing new resources for the Kenyan camp as they think of how to plan and run camps in their countries, demonstrating that students can learn from interactions with computers and from each other.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The maths&nbsp;clubs initiatives in schools in tandem with the camps will scale the camps as 52 students who are potential maths&nbsp;game ambassadors from 29 schools were released back to </span><span style=\"color:rgb(32,33,36);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">introduce and play maths&nbsp;games with whoever they have access to including siblings, friends, classmates, family members, and support them to engage by embedding maths&nbsp;game activities into their daily activities.</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;Teachers from the Network of schools who attended camp Reported that this year's national examinations required critical thinking to solve problems, an advantage to previous camp participants who were sitting and admitted the positive impact of the camp while they sat their examinations.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;Special thanks to the kind sponsors: Supporting African Maths Initiative (SAMI), African Maths Initiative (AMI), INNODEMS, IDEMS and &nbsp;Kongoni Community Library (KCL) &nbsp;who made this maths camp a success. We’d like to offer our gratitude to &nbsp;Parents, teachers, individuals, schools, and organisations that sponsored students to this holiday maths camp.</span></p>",

However, the Supporting African Maths Initiative Organization offers internships to both undergraduate and postgraduate registered with the TSC or in the process. In this blog post, I’ll tell you the story of my life as a Maths Consultant and give you some general advice and opportunities you get while on Internship with SAMI and AMI.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The application process</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">I first became aware of this role when a teacher from the Maths Outreach team came to visit the school I was helping in teaching Mathematics after my fourth year in University awaiting my graduation. It was the end of the last week of term two, he&nbsp; encouraged me to apply and I was given Mr. Mbasu’s contact who directed me on the application process. The role very much appealed to me from there (for reasons that will be highlighted later on!) and so I applied online immediately after. A couple of days later, I received an email telling me that I had been shortlisted for the interviews, which I was both excited and nervous about, seeing as up until then I had never done the interviews before.</span></span><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Around a week after that, I was blessed with the news that I had finally become a maths Consultant at SAMI, the internship that was to last for only one year.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>My role</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">When I’m working as a maths Consultant, it’s fair to say that no two days are ever the same. Depending on the type of event I’m working on, my duties as a consultant can vary immensely. However, some general responsibilities include (but are not limited to):</span></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">develop /adapt SAMI resources for students with special needs.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Engage teachers and students with these resources in special needs schools.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Encourage the set up of new Maths clubs/ Improve maths clubs in special needs schools.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Help plan for and run maths camps.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Develop teaching and learning resources for the kenyan curriculum including uses of the software packages Geogebra and STACK.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving support to AMI internees.</span></span></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">The role is paid with flexible projects, meaning that if you have any project in mind you are invited to bring it forward.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do I love about my job?</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">In all honesty, I love absolutely everything about being a Maths&nbsp; consultant, but as I mentioned before, the role did appeal to me for many reasons. Firstly, I knew that being a Maths Consultant would give me the opportunity to meet new people, not just within AMI, SAMI, INNODEMS but also young people from schools around East African Countries, and being able to encourage both girls and boys to study Maths at university and talk about my experiences as a maths student is something that I still enjoy to this day. Secondly, being aConsultant for the School of Maths and Special Needs schools pushes me to take on new challenges and different levels of responsibility, and through this I can develop my transferable skills such as communication,Kenyan Sign Language skills, leadership and teamwork. I have definitely grown as an individual since starting out as an Internee and now Consultant!</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Since I started my Internship at AMI I have had the opportunity to learn</span></span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"> </span></span><span style=\"color:#434343;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Grok, I was able to learn Introduction to Programming (Python).
