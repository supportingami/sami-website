Following the classic proverb ‘it takes a village’ we aim to bring people together of all ages and vocations to use technology for good through education, training and research.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">SAMI will draw on the experience and expertise its members, local partners across Africa and further international experts to design series of interventions that will all be run using tablet computers and facilitated by local university students and NGOs. &nbsp;Initially we will be looking to use the tablets to impact on the following areas:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Primary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Secondary Schools</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Agriculture</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://samicharity.co.uk/introducing-digital-communities-initiative/#\"><strong>Women's Enterprises</strong></a></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"dci-1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dci-1.png?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" width=\"300\" loading=\"eager\">Tablets will be loaded with apps proven to help students improve basic numeracy skills, reading skills, and make a shift from rote “chalk and talk” learning to more learner-centered approaches. It is our hope that by doing this these children will be given a strong foundation of basic education, something vital so that they do not get left behind in the future.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br><strong>The next steps</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A fantastic team of local and international experts are currently being assembled whilst equipment is put together and resources developed. Project meetings will be taking place across August with an official launch in September 2016.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For more information you can follow <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/supportingami\">SAMI on facebook</a>, or contact <a href=\"mailto:chris@supportingami.org\">chris@supportingami.org</a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/samicharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconEduFoundation-square120-1.png?resize=120%2C117&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"EconEduFoundation-square120-1\" loading=\"eager\"></a>SAMI would also like to give a huge thanks to the generosity of the<a href=\"http://www.economistfoundation.org/\"> Economist Foundation</a> for making the Digital Communities Initiative possible.</p>",
