For several years, he has been engaged in a number of research and teaching initiatives in East Africa, organising workshops and summer schools in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia and Kenya in particular. He mentors research groups at the University of Nairobi and Makerere University. He is on the council of the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>",
