These camps introduce students to advanced mathematical concepts not typically found in the classroom, covering themes such as modelling, combinatorics, programming, code breaking, statistics, non-Euclidean geometry, and game theory.

These camps are primarily funded through student registration fees, with many students receiving reduced fees to ensure broad accessibility.

With a focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing formulas, students develop essential problem-solving skills and a deeper appreciation for mathematics. Many participants return to school with enhanced performance in mathematics and other subjects.</p><h3 data-start=\"2034\" data-end=\"2050\">Inclusivity:</h3><p data-start=\"2051\" data-end=\"2440\">The camps are open to all high school students aged 14 to 18, with no entry requirements. There is a strong emphasis on fostering diversity by ensuring an equal representation of students from different socio-economic backgrounds and academic abilities. The camps strive to maintain a balanced gender ratio, and participants come from a wide range of public, private, and national schools.</p><h3 data-start=\"2442\" data-end=\"2471\">Technology &amp; Development:</h3><p data-start=\"2472\" data-end=\"2815\">Technology plays a pivotal role in the camps, with tools like Geogebra and Scratch used to allow students to explore mathematics interactively. The camps also prioritize the development of new educational resources.
