However, the Supporting African Maths Initiative Organization offers internships to both undergraduate and postgraduate registered with the TSC or in the process. In this blog post, I’ll tell you the story of my life as a Maths Consultant and give you some general advice and opportunities you get while on Internship with SAMI and AMI.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The application process</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">I first became aware of this role when a teacher from the Maths Outreach team came to visit the school I was helping in teaching Mathematics after my fourth year in University awaiting my graduation. It was the end of the last week of term two, he&nbsp; encouraged me to apply and I was given Mr. Mbasu’s contact who directed me on the application process. The role very much appealed to me from there (for reasons that will be highlighted later on!) and so I applied online immediately after. A couple of days later, I received an email telling me that I had been shortlisted for the interviews, which I was both excited and nervous about, seeing as up until then I had never done the interviews before.</span></span><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Around a week after that, I was blessed with the news that I had finally become a maths Consultant at SAMI, the internship that was to last for only one year.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>My role</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">When I’m working as a maths Consultant, it’s fair to say that no two days are ever the same. Depending on the type of event I’m working on, my duties as a consultant can vary immensely. However, some general responsibilities include (but are not limited to):</span></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">develop /adapt SAMI resources for students with special needs.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Engage teachers and students with these resources in special needs schools.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Encourage the set up of new Maths clubs/ Improve maths clubs in special needs schools.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Help plan for and run maths camps.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Develop teaching and learning resources for the kenyan curriculum including uses of the software packages Geogebra and STACK.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving support to AMI internees.</span></span></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">The role is paid with flexible projects, meaning that if you have any project in mind you are invited to bring it forward.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#0D3273;font-family:Roboto;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do I love about my job?</strong></span></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">In all honesty, I love absolutely everything about being a Maths&nbsp; consultant, but as I mentioned before, the role did appeal to me for many reasons. Firstly, I knew that being a Maths Consultant would give me the opportunity to meet new people, not just within AMI, SAMI, INNODEMS but also young people from schools around East African Countries, and being able to encourage both girls and boys to study Maths at university and talk about my experiences as a maths student is something that I still enjoy to this day. Secondly, being aConsultant for the School of Maths and Special Needs schools pushes me to take on new challenges and different levels of responsibility, and through this I can develop my transferable skills such as communication,Kenyan Sign Language skills, leadership and teamwork. I have definitely grown as an individual since starting out as an Internee and now Consultant!</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0cm;\"><span style=\"color:#393F49;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Since I started my Internship at AMI I have had the opportunity to learn</span></span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\"> </span></span><span style=\"color:#434343;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" dir=\"ltr\">Grok, I was able to learn Introduction to Programming (Python).

How can we ensure that we can achieve rapid learning and rapid execution to stay ahead?<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">After years of conversations, research, and meaningful collaboration with universities, research institutions, and colleges, we were glad to collaborate with Manor House Agricultural College, African Maths Initiative, and IDEMS International. January 2020 saw us offer a month-long Foundational in 21st Century Skills course. One of the major aims was to cultivate skills such as programming, critical and logical thinking, media making, data literacy, and communication among persons of different backgrounds. These students could be young people awaiting to join universities,colleges or self-employment, current university/college students, unemployed youth, or professionals who would want to learn these skills.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We took in 12 students for a start and within a month the young and timid students had grown in remarkable ways. Things did not end there. As part of our capacity building, we took in six of these students as interns since February 2020. This was a chance for the students to work on a Collaborative Group Project on Web Technologies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">They are now learning employable skills in web and app development. In just over three months, we have enabled them to learn skills useful in the work we are doing with our partners; Oxford, CWBSA, UNICEF, UCT and they are now fully involved in the development of Parenting For Long-life Health Mobile application which is a suite of open access, non-commercialized parenting programs to prevent violence in low-resource settings in 20 low and middle-income countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">While reminiscing about what they learned in January, flexibility, independent learning, and adapting to unexpected changes were a major part of the Foundational 21st Century Skills course back in January. Even though most of the classes were in a physical place, assignments, communication, and learning were online through platforms such as MOODLE. A few weeks after the lapse of the course, a coronavirus pandemic hit the world, and we now live in extraordinary times. The world transformed within months if not weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Virtual work became the only option for us and luckily, we had introduced them to this world of work and we are glad to have this team of learners and our other Kenyan team collaboratively work on projects such as Parenting for Long-Life with other teams across the world. The team is meeting regularly to discuss what’s needed for the application they are contributing to.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We understand that this learning while working virtually will be a process for all of us. But we have to do this to keep safe as we can and wait for things to get better.</p>",

In these new realities, there is an urgent need to invest now in education systems/programs that can help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s education. What roles can different organizations play to either support schools, children or teachers to address the challenges presented by this pandemic?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For over 8 years, Supporting African Maths Initiatives (SAMI) has long supported innovative STEM education programs that supplement classroom learning and draw from existing best practices in education theory. In some of our programs, we have leveraged on the power of open source technology to make learning possible in different schools. Some of our programs that required school visits have been disrupted but we are finding ways to keep on supporting teachers and schools in Africa.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Some of our programs have been addressing gaps in teacher training and promoting the use of technology in teaching and learning of mathematics in secondary schools in countries such as Kenya and Ghana. This is one area that we have chosen to focus on under these new realities.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With only two hours difference, it’s noon in London and 2:00 pm in Kenya. Three facilitators, Emily, Samuel, and Jacob are engaging secondary school maths teachers in virtual training using google hangouts and GeoGebra. In this session, the teachers were exploring geometrical shapes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These teams of trainers have been working hard to create Geogebra teacher training resources. GeoGebra is mathematics software for all levels of education that brings together geometry, algebra, spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Other teams within SAMI and African Maths Initiative (AMI) have been designing and authoring interactive mathematics using the System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel (STACK) for Moodle. This is an online computer-aided assessment system for mathematics that also randomly generates problems in a structured mathematical way, establishes the mathematical properties of expressions entered by students and it also generates feedback, as necessary, which may include mathematical computations of the student’s answer.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">These efforts could enable teachers, schools, and countries to prepare alternative learning programmes in the case of prolonged school closures by ensuring the continuity of quality learning and access to remote learning programs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">We believe that actively pursuing content creation and knowledge sharing through teacher training and capacity building will help us to deploy innovative and scalable solutions that boost mathematical literacy now and in the future.

Whilst searching the app store for ‘Maths Education’ the options seem near endless, the number with a strong base of evidence for improving learning are few and far between. If you also include those which are available in local languages, or at least that have been used in East Africa the results became practically non-existent.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The real stand-out amongst the rest was an app called <a href=\"https://onebillion.org/\">OneBillion</a>, created by a team in the UK but piloted in Malawi it aims to help build basic numeracy skills for children aged 3-7. It has been subject to a number of rigorous, randomised control trials, and consistently shown impressive results both in Africa and back in the UK.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png\" alt=\"2019_07-onebillion_Large.png\" srcset=\"/uploads/thumbnail_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 245w,/uploads/small_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 500w,/uploads/medium_2019_07_onebillion_Large_c3e245556c.png 750w,\" sizes=\"100vw\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A lot has happened in the nearly 3-years since starting this project.

These teams were reduced to 5 finalists, which then spent a further 2 years undergoing a large scale trial of their apps with 2,500 students in Tanzania.

The subject had six sessions planned to be carried out in the mathcamp. This contains the factors and multiples, world cup combinatorics, Divisibility rule, Barcode trick, olympic rings and Venn Diagram. The sessions were designed to instil a serious issue. The sessions were designed to establish in the participants a solid understanding of mathematics, a methodical approach to thinking, and a high degree of organisation.</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Factors and multiples </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">a session driven by the ability to observe and formulate hypotheses into strategies.

The physical activities that formed an integral part of this theme include Trading game, concentration game, flag game, mingle mingle, find the ball and treasure hunt.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Concentration games</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">build concentration, good memory, better coordination and have fun. The participants and the team leader stand in a circle and the team leader says “concentration is the game, keep the rhythm if you can”. The crowd repeats, as they clap twice and tap their legs twice. Continue clapping like that. In the meantime, the leader says his own name twice and someone else's name twice.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Flag game</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The group is split into two teams and they then stand in two lines facing each other. One person needs to be in the middle to call and judge. In the middle of the two teams an (object) is placed. Each player is numbered with someone on the other side. Each round the caller calls a number and each matching pair must race to get the ball and get back to their line before being touched. If touched the ball goes to the other side, points may be kept.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Mingle mingle </strong></span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The players move around mingling as the leader chants\" In twos, In threes etc\" as the players from the groups with the total number that is said out aloud.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Find the ball</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">This is a team activity involving one blind folded individual from a team who has to be directed by their respective team towards a certain object(ball).

They found some of the puzzles challenging but they still found enjoyment in the process of discovery and solving them. They could then solve the challenging puzzles as a class every morning before the camp’s normal sessions start off.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Games and puzzles at the Camp gave the students the opportunities to explore problem solving concepts since they were able to take the role of facilitation. The students were more than just problem solvers, they supported others to engage in games and puzzles by making sure that: others understood the puzzles, encouraged them to ask questions for clarification, broke down the puzzle into smaller parts and they were able to reframe the puzzles. Games were played in groups, each group had a different facilitator for different games who was able to actively tell stories and create activities which related the mathematical ideas to spark memory for the other participants in the group.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Treasure hunt </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The maths camp treasure hunt taught the participants how much fun it is to solve problems in their own unique ways. It gave participants the chance to assist others in solving challenges by observing where they are and guiding them to the next move. To advance to the next station, teams have to solve puzzles. They will learn the upcoming puzzles at these stations. Through this self-directed activity, the participants learned the value of sequencing—the order of steps—and were given the freedom to finish a task independently in each of their respective groups. Before moving on to the treasure, each group completed at least eight puzzles out of the two that were provided at each station.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Quick Math </strong></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Nine mathematics problems were given to participants every day for ten minutes before lunch.

Working with others allowed them to pool their thoughts and look at problems from different angles. During competitions for example in physical activity and treasure hunt, members of the houses utilised a variety of skills and expertise they have to strategize and solve problems. Working in houses also allowed for more in-depth and broad research, as well as the opportunity to learn from one another by discussing, gaming, and playing, as well as exploring questions and thoughts and receiving feedback from peers.</span></p><h1 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Maths Game Ambassador and Next Steps</span></h1><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Since the training of level 1 ambassadors earlier in the year and inspiring active champions and ambassadors of maths</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;games during both camps, the trained envoys are out of school and ready to learn together and serve the community in curriculum-agnostic mathematics.

The basis of this math camp was to present exciting themes to students on problem solving that will allow them to integrate the concepts into practice and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM subjects.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Teachers&nbsp;and volunteers met for a week to prepare and were trained as Maths game envoys with excitement to support everyone in engaging in thinking through inclusive, fun activities. The students were introduced to different themes through activities and experiences and learnt skills in computational thinking, logical thinking, critical thinking, and mathematical thinking that are useful to address the central theme in problem solving.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The Camp brought together 37&nbsp;students from 18 secondary schools around the country. The students were taken through seven themes that integrated technological use in collaborative activities where everyone—including the accompanying teachers—learned through fun activities. The themes included mathematical thinking, data science, programming and robotics, physical activity, treasure hunt, modeling, and games and puzzles.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">After a lengthy break, the students will return to class to support others in learning and using the resources provided as ambassadors for math games and to run math clubs employing the activities from the VMC card decks.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Themes</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:624px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ITm8H3W0uAyeT0zVJ1YANYWAlLOyQy2BBb25LmrCQ5BXbMD-_DP7u0hHy1y_tyvHAHgI8yQQxfD2wNZsQfMPKx8s-pE0k86R4Rb3_mhSMMwWthXp1GZYBhg8K1On4JriRrt9qzp3O2zyvAQMsYKA9E4\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

This theme engaged the students in computational thinking as a &nbsp;way of planning, problem-solving and analyzing information the same way a computer does as a way to logically think through problems, breaking them down into smaller pieces, identifying patterns, and then using the knowledge to come up with a step-by-step solution.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The sessions introduced students to programming by issuing instructions through dragging and dropping to join blocks&nbsp;in&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blockly.games/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1694028141647483&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mb2luR-iTicwA-QIFnPas\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><u>blockly games</u></span></a><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;and working with Edison robot, using blocks and in scratch before further proceeding to scratch to create games and animations as projects.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The students used graphical blocks to represent code concepts like variables, loops, logical expressions and more. This allowed students to focus on learning the programming fundamentals without having to worry about the syntax.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Modeling</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Challenges from real life can be translated into mathematical language through modeling problems and assessing the solution in the real world. It was clear that numerous tools, like Geogebra and physical sessions to simulate how models work and &nbsp;converted to math language, were used to make these theme goals a success.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Josephus Problem</strong>&nbsp;session was an extension to mingling game where the students were encouraged to get into groups of different numbers and make a circle, player at position one was to point player at position two and position two had to sit down and it continues until the last player remain standing and was to record the last number of player standing.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Josephus Problem introduced students to pattern and sequence and the students were to record the numbers of last player remaining standing and come up with the observation which was to help them guess the pattern as the number of players increased.&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Exponential growth of population activity</strong>&nbsp;is important and topical, a good example of the application of mathematics to a real life issue. It provides a basis for discussion of exponential growth and decay at a simple level. It provides data and graphs that give learners practice in interpretation and analysis and learning how to assess them critically. The activity provided practice for learners &nbsp;to recognize how to use GeoGebra on exponential functions, also in recognizing transformations of exponential functions and identifying the effects of transformations on the graphs of functions. Additionally, it introduces learners to higher level mathematics.

At first students used matchsticks to make triangles of different types (Right angled, equilateral e.t.c) and recorded their edge(s) length. We then used the edges recorded to prove which ones satisfy the triangular inequality and which ones do not. We discovered that some fit and others don’t. This implies that their modeling was subject to errors. We then proceeded to use the GeoGebra tool and came up with different sets of perfect triangles which all could fit the triangular inequality.

This lesson focuses on explaining to students the networks involved in disease spread in a given population. It also introduced learners to understand the concept of basic reproduction number, how it is calculated, and how its value affects disease spread (when the value is negative, positive or equal to one). Students in the whole class were involved to form the network involved in disease spread.

Calculus can be used to describe the concept of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, which is also referred to as kinematics. Participants in the math camp had the chance to simulate displacement, velocity, and acceleration and comprehend their importance in everyday life.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Mathematical Thinking</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Thinking mathematically to solve problems is strongly encouraged at mathcamp, which includes using critical thinking skills to identify patterns that are useful. One of the camp's recurring themes was mathematical thinking. Six sessions were planned for the subject during the mathcamp. This includes the factors and multiples, binary numbers, the barcode trick, the Olympic rings, &nbsp;Venn Diagram, the frogs party &nbsp;and &nbsp;Joseph problem. The lessons were made to implant in the participants a strong grasp of mathematics,organization and &nbsp;a methodical way of thinking.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Magic squares: </strong>The session contained squares with whole numbers written inside each cell, so that the total sum of every number in each row and column, and in each primary and secondary diagonal is equal. During the session, we used 3*3 squares with the use of numbers 1 to 9 &nbsp;total sum is 15. Students arranged numbers in cells in different ways to solve the square. The session was the foundation of other mathematical thinking sessions.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Factors and multiples: </strong>The session is advancing on magic squares driven by the ability to observe and formulate hypotheses into strategies. Participants looked at several puzzle grids that needed factor tricks to solve and deduce a plan of action.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Barcodes </strong>are essential because they assist retailers in setting the appropriate pricing and monitoring sales. EAN bar codes of 13 digits are supported by some incredible math. Participants were able to observe how important the check digit is and how the scanner performs computations to match the check digit.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Binary Numbers &nbsp;</strong>Math ideas can be taught through magic tricks. The use of magic tricks to introduce binary to math camp participants was the ideal situation. Recognizing binary digits and using 0s and 1s to represent numbers. Converting numbers to binary place value improved understanding of the notion of binary.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>The Olympic game/magic/ring </strong>session introduced learners to the concept of the use of venn diagrams. An olympic emblem &nbsp;(The Olympic emblem consists of five overlapping rings containing nine regions), was drawn and the main idea was to Place the numbers 1, 2, 3, … 9 in the nine regions so that the total in each ring is the same. Some students used trial and error to get the solutions but some students creatively found more systematic methods of getting the solutions.

It also helped students to solve complex mathematical problems which were in the form of a riddle and provided an intuitive understanding of multiple regression analysis between more variables.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Data Science</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The camp participants worked with data in 6 different sessions focussed on data entry, examining data displays, coming up with a questionnaire, data collection, exploring data, discovering with data and problem solving with data. They worked with different data sets, summarized, visualized and interpreted data advancing their skills to use data as evidence to support their claims.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Introduction to Statistics </strong>It was the opening session. &nbsp;We introduced the session by collecting data from students as a student entry survey. Data collected during the session were used during other sessions like; data cleaning and statistical data analysis. In the session, students were introduced to data collection techniques like questionnaires. An example of statistical data was the average life of Kenyan life and students came up with questionnaires about average student life. &nbsp;The main objective of this session was to introduce students to how to express their daily activities mathematically more so statistically.</span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KrZh87EvpXa7vfOKIIJ9_yJ85K4YTtz-&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1694028141655033&amp;usg=AOvVaw39jXz06y6K8er4bicayJ_N\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><u>Here</u></span></a><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;are &nbsp;students questionnaires</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:405.97px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZxU9-q7RJzMTTz2fa_LNY4mYmEYtd84IkWxFBQgGMyvDMoHyXdsuivj9MDFSZaWZ0qfC64ptdPViEOLAzwC-4tW9UPzOTPaCDblgaz1OnICdCplTll6g0WnfuAhxSohrRKbLjp8aaBeOqc2f7fCkZ_Q\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:361.33px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UMf47K2vxrK1BmCSdZA1jJD0Lw9n4QZi8qXvg0Mqm9iZwuPsTaRzYKVOE3xYXdEukysq_SbuEwwQwIBxCobL4cmLZ6iAtc03DAba4rEgXd3YNeRV64nDoMHUyjR--c0n0vTJs7gJ9knI3RmfQGP988A\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><i>Fig: Sample questions from students investigating the ‘average students’ life’.</i></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Data Cleaning &nbsp;</strong>session was done where the data collected during maths&nbsp;camp entry survey session was fixed by removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate or incomplete data within that dataset.

Students had the opportunity to think about the gap in the world today and challenge preconceived ideas about how the contemporary world looks.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Students were able to discover different attributes of countries that make other countries famous and better than others. Students used different data provided on Gapminder and presented it on Excel by coming up with different presentations like pie charts, bar graphs and line graphs. This was &nbsp;to show that they were able to understand the previous session on Statistical Data analysis in which they were introduced to Excel as one way of representing Data.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Students explored Gapminder and used the data provided to show their Problem Solving technique.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Physical Activities</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The camp programs included enjoyable, inclusive games where everyone was expected to participate in outdoor physical activities. Physical activities gave all math campers a chance to study a variety of core ideas, including counting, patterns, computing techniques, and other significant mathematical ideas. This theme's physical activities included the following games: concentration game, flag game, mingle mingle, find the ball,buzz, Card game and treasure hunt.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Concentration games</strong>&nbsp;enhance your memory, coordination, and focus while having fun. The team leader tells the members to focus on the game and try to keep the beat while they stand in a circle. The crowd claps twice and taps its legs twice before repeating. Keep clapping in that manner. The leader alternates between saying his own name twice and another person's name twice.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Flag game</strong>&nbsp;after being divided into two teams, the individuals stand in two lines facing one another. To call and decide, one person must be in the center. An object is placed in the center of the two teams. Each player is paired with a number from the opposing side. Each time a matching pair is called, they have one round to race to retrieve the ball and return to their line without being touched. Points may be kept if the ball touches someone before going to the other side.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Card game </strong>Cards ranging from Ace to Ten are dealt to each team. Each team's 10 cards are dealt face down at random onto a table in front of them. The players run up one at a time and flip a card over. If it isn't the Ace, they turn it over again and sprint back to their team, where the following player gets a turn. They can lay the ace face up at the head of the table once it has been revealed. Card two is needed next, and so on. Play continues until one team has all of its cards properly flipped face up.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Buzz &nbsp;</strong>The participants sit in a huge circle. The count begins with one player stating \"1,\" and continues around the circle with the next player shouting \"2.\" Any number that contains a 3 or is divisible by 3 needs to have the word \"Buzz\" substituted for it. When someone makes a mistake, the game resumes at step 1.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Mingle mingle&nbsp;</strong> The leader chants, \"In twos, In threes, etc.\" as the players from the groups with the total number that is spoken aloud go around mingling.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Find the ball</strong>&nbsp; This is a group activity where each team must guide a member of their team who is blindfolded towards a specific object. The activity encourages effective teamwork from the team as well as communication and individual focus.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Games and Puzzles</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The students solved various games and puzzles daily. The activities covered a number of areas including: Logic puzzles, Time distance maths, Brain Teasers, Probability concepts and Number challenge(s).</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Puzzles were placed in the walls within their learning library section for the students to solve whenever they were free, most of the students could write them up in the evening and do as take home assignments. They found some of the puzzles challenging but they still found enjoyment in the process of discovery and solving them. They could then solve the challenging puzzles as a class every morning before the camp’s normal sessions start off.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Games and puzzles at the Camp gave the students the opportunities to explore problem solving concepts since they were able to take the role of facilitation. The students were more than just problem solvers, they supported others to engage in games and puzzles by making sure that: others understood the puzzles, encouraged them to ask questions for clarification, broke down the puzzle into smaller parts and they were able to reframe the puzzles. Games were played in groups, each group had a different facilitator for different games who was able to actively tell stories and create activities which related the mathematical ideas to spark memory for the other participants in the group.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Treasure hunt </strong>Maths Camp Treasure Hunt taught students the importance of working together and embracing teamwork, collaboration and discussion. It was fun for students to solve puzzles as a group. Treasure Hunt encouraged students to seek guidance from facilitators each time they were not able to solve challenges after getting hints, they were able to solve the puzzles.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">To move on to the next station, each group had to solve two puzzles in which they added the sum of the two solutions which was the location for the next station. They then have to read the map and find the location of the sum on the Map.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><strong>Quick Math &nbsp;</strong>session involved<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Eight mathematics problems were given to participants every day for ten minutes before lunch. Renamed “Quick Math” During this session, the students went into their houses, and each house received points for each accurate response. The lesson challenged students to utilize their minds alone, no pens,no calculators. The questions displayed in this session normally build on each other concept-wise from day one.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Journals</span></h1><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Students were encouraged to consider what went well, what they did not understand,what could be improved, what they had learnt and constructive feedback then write anonymous notes and submit them the next day before the start of the session. These journals are useful in determining what works and what doesn't during the camp.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The journals were a great opportunity for the students to actively reflect on good and bad experiences, draw out key learning points and influence their future actions.

Establishing AMI, they started projects such as undergraduate mathematics electronic courseware, new lecturer training, community education through e-learning and the Maseno Maths Camp.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The first Maseno Maths Camp was run in August 2011 by a mixture of local and international volunteers. The camp was aimed at secondary pupils in Kenyan schools and was an incredible success; students were taken outside of their normal school curriculum, many were introduced to computers for the first time, and were given the opportunity to start thinking about maths as a dynamic subject, rather than just a list of formulae and methods to be memorised. Sessions were designed to give students insights into new areas of mathematics, rather that teach small topics thoroughly.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The Maseno Maths Camp has been held every year since. In 2012 whilst attending the second camp, a group of educators, mathematicians and enthusiasts based in the UK established SAMI. Apart from the maths camps, one of SAMI’s main aims is to test scalable solutions to improve the mathematics education in the countries in which we operate. We have extended our camps and clubs projects to include Ethiopia in 2013, Ghana in 2014 and London as a fundraiser in 2014, and this summer we are setting up the first camp in Tanzania.</p>",

We would be happy to hear from people in other walks of life who feel they have something to contribute, and we would consider recommending high school students for this experience.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The recruitment of international volunteers has begun and we will be considering applications on a rolling basis until the start of the camps.&nbsp;You can mention a preference for a camp in your application, but you don’t have to.&nbsp;Decisions on applications will be made by the SAMI Trustees, who then recommend suitable candidates to the local organisers of the respective camps. Note: all camps are run through local partners. As such, dates and venues are subject to change.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Do not make any flight or accommodation booking until you have confirmed the camp dates with the local organiser</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">SAMI cannot accept responsibility for any financial loss occurred due to the changes in dates or venues for any of the camps.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">FAQs can&nbsp;be found below.&nbsp;If you would like to know more&nbsp;please write to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:admin@supportingami.org\">admin@supportingami.org</a>. We’re happy to give you more information by email and would be happy to meet you&nbsp;in person.</p>",
